### Python Tutorial
This is a concise python tutorial for beginners. The purpose is to provide a 
foundation to onboard Python while keeping enough interest. While there are 
many resources, such as internet posts, books, and video, this tutorial tries 
to put more emphasize to practical usage of Python. It does not try to cover 
all aspects of the language, which is an impossible goal to reach in a short 
journey. Instead, it tries to layout a foundation of the language so that 
users can grasp the essence now and then expand the horizon later. Defining 
the proper scope of the foundation is challenging and subjective, along with 
building up blocks step by step progressively. Googling along the way is proven
to be helpful as well.
