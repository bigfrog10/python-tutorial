### Python Tutorial
This is a concise python tutorial for beginners. The purpose is to provide a 
foundation to onboard Python while keeping enough interest. While there are 
many resources, such as internet posts, books, and video, this tutorial tries 
to put more emphasize to practical usage of Python. It does not try to cover 
all aspects of the language, which is an impossible goal to reach in a short 
journey. Instead, it lays out the necessary topics of the language in a 
specific order so that 
users can grasp the essence now and then expand the horizon later. Defining 
the proper scope and topics of the foundation is challenging, time-consuming
and subjective, along with 
building up blocks step by step progressively.

All code can be run locally in one thread, one process. This is one of the
scope criteria.

#### Chapter 1. Numbers
___
- Integers
- Floating Numbers
- Other numbers: Complex Numbers, Rationals, and Decimals 
- Math functions

#### Chapter 2. Strings
___
- Regular Expression

#### Chapter 3. Collections
___
- List and Tuple
- Dictionary
- Set
- Named Tuple
- Comprehension
- Deep Copy

#### Chapter 4. Booleans and Flow Controls
___
- Boolean 
- If
- For
- While

#### Chapter 5. Functions and Lambdas
___
- Functions are reusable code
- Logging
- Exceptions
- Performance Profiling
- As code gets more complex, we need unit tests
    - simple test cases
    - run in IDE 
    - default naming is test_*, can be overwritten.
- packages and modules
    - package paths have to be uniquely globally. If one lib uses a path, then
      this path can't be used elsewhere in the global. So it's better to create
      top unique package name. Python does not do package merging. This is a
      big drawback in my view.

___
- Generators
- Decorators


#### Chapter 7. Classes and Testing
___
- Inheritance
- Pickle
- More Unit Tests

    - mock
    - test coverage

- Iterator
- Decorator

#### Chapter 9. Date and Time
___
- date and time
