## Python Tutorial
This is the python tutorial used for my kids and friends. The purpose is to 
provide a foundation to onboard Python while keeping enough interest. While 
there are many resources, such as internet posts, books, and video, this 
tutorial tries to put more emphasize to practical usage of Python. It does not 
try to cover all aspects of the language, which is an impossible goal to reach. 
Instead, it tries to layout a foundation of the language so that users can 
grasp the essence now and then expand the horizon later. Defining the proper 
scope of the foundation is challenging, along with building up blocks step by 
step progressively.
